# DynaStandard_public
This Dynamo extension was developed to create a Dynamo content library to help distribute this content to all, have easy access to graph(s) templates, any standard documentation related to dynamo, and now automatically sets new/opening of graphs to "manual" run without any more worry for if it is or not.

#### Note:

When i started this extension i wasnt sure if i would release the code or not, well i have made a choice that i will release the code. Though this is likely to happen after i have done switched the forms to wpf windows, sorted some code out and released a comfortable version for package manager.
