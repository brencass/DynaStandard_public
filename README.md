# DynaStandard_public
The original idea for my Dynamo extension was to develop a Dynamo content library to help distribute content to all, have easy access to graph templates and any standard documentation related to dynamo. The remit has expanded to include a way to automatically set scripts to manual when opened, set custom package location and a way to re-run dynamo scripts without closing and reopening them.

#### Note:

When i started this extension i wasnt sure if i would release the code or not, well i have made a choice that i will release the code. Though this is likely to happen after i have done switched the forms to wpf windows, sorted some code out and released a comfortable version for package manager.
